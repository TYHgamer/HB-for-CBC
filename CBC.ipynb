      "Warning: Your Stan program has a parameter tau with a lower and upper bound in its declaration. These hard constraints are not recommended, for two reasons: (a) Except when there are logical or physical constraints, it is very unusual for you to be sure that a parameter will fall inside a specified range, and (b) The infinite gradient induced by a hard constraint can cause difficulties for Stan's sampling algorithm. As a consequence, we recommend soft constraints rather than hard constraints; for example, instead of constraining an elasticity parameter to fall between 0, and 1, leave it unconstrained and give it a normal(0.5,0.5) prior distribution.\n"

      "Warning: Your Stan program has a parameter tau with a lower and upper bound in its declaration. These hard constraints are not recommended, for two reasons: (a) Except when there are logical or physical constraints, it is very unusual for you to be sure that a parameter will fall inside a specified range, and (b) The infinite gradient induced by a hard constraint can cause difficulties for Stan's sampling algorithm. As a consequence, we recommend soft constraints rather than hard constraints; for example, instead of constraining an elasticity parameter to fall between 0, and 1, leave it unconstrained and give it a normal(0.5,0.5) prior distribution.\n"
